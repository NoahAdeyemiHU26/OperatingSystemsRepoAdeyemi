## Overview

`shell.c` is a custom Unix-like shell implemented in C. It provides a command-line interface for users to execute built-in and external commands, manage processes, handle signals, perform I/O redirection, and use simple piping. This shell is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates core concepts of process management, signal handling, and input/output manipulation in Unix systems.

## Features

### 1. **Prompt and Command Input**
- Displays the current working directory as part of the prompt.
- Accepts user input for commands, supporting arguments and environment variable expansion (e.g., `$HOME`).

### 2. **Built-in Commands**
- `cd [dir]`: Change the current working directory. Defaults to `$HOME` if no directory is specified.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `echo [args...]`: Print arguments to standard output, with support for environment variable expansion.
- `env [VAR ...]`: Print environment variables. If arguments are given, prints only those variables.
- `setenv VAR VALUE`: Set an environment variable.
- `exit`: Exit the shell.

### 3. **External Commands**
- Executes programs found in the system's `PATH` using `fork()` and `execvp()`.
- Passes command-line arguments to external programs.

### 4. **Foreground and Background Processes**
- Commands can be run in the background by appending `&` at the end of the command line (e.g., `sleep 10 &`).
- The shell immediately returns to the prompt after starting a background process.
- Foreground processes are waited on by the shell.

### 5. **Signal Handling**
- The shell ignores `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C) to prevent itself from being terminated.
- Foreground child processes restore the default `SIGINT` behavior, allowing them to be terminated by Ctrl-C.
- Background processes are not affected by Ctrl-C from the shell.

### 6. **Timeout for Foreground Processes**
- Foreground processes are automatically terminated if they run longer than 10 seconds.
- The shell uses `alarm()` and a `SIGALRM` handler to enforce this timeout.
- If a process is killed due to timeout, a message is displayed.

### 7. **I/O Redirection**
- **Output Redirection (`>`):** Redirects standard output to a file (e.g., `ls > out.txt`).
- **Input Redirection (`<`):** Redirects standard input from a file (e.g., `cat < in.txt`).

### 8. **Piping**
- Supports a single pipe (`|`) between two commands (e.g., `cat file.txt | grep pattern`).
- The output of the first command is passed as input to the second command.
